## Introduction to Static C++ Arrays
### What is an array?

What is an array and how is it useful?  By now, you have already discovered and used the various data types available in C++: int, char, float, and double.  In the most simple definition, arrays are just single structures that are capable of holding many instances of these data types.

### Declaration:
Declaring an array is fairly straight-forward:
1) Specify the data type (int, char, float, double)
2) Name the array
3) Give the array its size by placing the the size value inside of the subscript operator '[x]' (where x denotes the size of the array)
4) End with a statement terminator ';'
